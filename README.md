# DatabaseManagementSQL

# This project deals with the Onsite Data Modeling process. We took homedepot.com and created a sample database to manage 
# the store operations. Based on the partial conceptual model designed earlier and with the website products and departments as
# reference, we designed the database with appropriate attributes, constraints and relationships for the objects in the database. 
# Further we scripted few DCL statements to manage the security of the database.
# We perform some store transactional and administrative analysis with complex SQL queries.
